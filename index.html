      <p>
        Arya is the youngest daughter of Lord Eddard and Lady Catelyn Stark. She
        is headstrong, more interested in swordplay than crochet and bored by
        the rituals of courtly life. She worships her father and is close to
        half-brother Jon (as parting gift before joining the Night’s Watch, he
        presented her with a sword, Needle). Like the Bastard of Winterfell,
        Arya has always thought of herself as an outsider – a young woman who’d
        rather forge her own destiny than abide by the conventions of her class
        and marry a rich husband.

      <p>
        Growing up in the grey, windswept north, Arya was a rebel with a cause.
        She wanted to prove to her brothers she was as tough and smart as
        they.Her freedom proved short-lived as she was snatched by The Hound,
        who liked the idea of ransoming Arya to the Starks . Their destination
        was The Twins and the wedding of her brother Robb. Striking up an
        unlikely buddy-movie relationship, Arya and The Hound reached the
        outskirts of the keep just as House Bolton had betrayed the Starks and
        turned the nuptials into a slaughter. Later, Arya killed a soldier who
        joked about sewing a dire wolf's head onto Robb Stark's body – the first
        occasion she consciously took a life.
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        She had crossed the Narrow Sea to Braavos, a Venice-like warren watched
        over by a giant iron Titan. She was en route to the House of Black and
        White, hoping to resume acquaintances with shape-shifting assassin Jaqen
        H'ghar.
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        The next we saw of Arya, she was deftly beheading a pigeon for supper.
        Unfortunately, Braavos was the not the sort of city where you simply
        walked around swinging a headless pigeon and she was quickly surrounded
        by local hoodlums. When an apparent doppleganger of the grumpy
        gatekeeper appeared the bullies fled. Back at the House of Black and
        White he removed his hood and, by the time the camera panned all the way
        behind Arya, had assumed the likeness of Jaqen. "Who are you?" Arya
        asked (she seemed to have dropped her pigeon in the excitement). "No
        one," he replied. "And that is what a girl must become." In the
        background, a sitar twanged exotically – a patented Game of Throne
        reminder we're not in dank, straightforward Westeros any more, Toto.

      <h4>Important Moments</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="cont1">
      <h5>Witnessing Her Father's Execution</h5>
      <p class="par">
        Arya's entire trajectory in life altered with the public beheading of
        Eddard Stark. With his passing, something inside her died too.
      </p>
      <h5>Taking Revenge on Poliver</h5>
      <p>
        Arya took her time dispatching the Lannister thug early in season four,
        sliding Needle into his throat so that he gargled his own blood – a
        repeat of the sadistic method by which he had dispatched her friend
        Lommy.
      </p>
      <h5>Leaving The Hound to Die</h5>
      <p class="par">
        The Stark girl's transition from naive tom-boy to cold-hearted survivor
        was sealed as she abandoned her companion with a fatal wound, ignoring
        his pleas for mercy.
      </p>
      <h5>The Red Wedding</h5>
      <p class="par">
        Arya was powerless to save her mother and brother from the treacherous
        Boltons. There was nothing she could do – and yet her helplessness
        continues to haunt her.
